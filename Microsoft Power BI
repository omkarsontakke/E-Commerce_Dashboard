In my Power BI project, I created an easy-to-use dashboard with
interactive charts and graphs. It displayed sales trends, top-selling
products, revenue metrics, customer demographics, and buying
preferences. Stakeholders could analyze this information to make
informed business decisions and improve overall performance.
